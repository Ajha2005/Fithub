I need a minimal but attractive, clean and sleek flask web frontend for my Gym Management Database project "FITHUB" .

=== BACKEND ALREADY COMPLETE ===

✅ PostgreSQL database: gym_management (localhost)

✅ 9 tables: members, membership_plans, member_subscriptions, attendance, equipment, equipment_maintenance, member_body_metrics, member_fitness_goals, member_engagement_scores

✅ Sample data: 100 members, 2000+ attendance records, all realistic Indian data

✅ PL/pgSQL procedures:

   - update_all_engagement_scores() - calculates engagement for all members

   - member_checkin(member_id) - validates and records check-in

   - process_expired_subscriptions() - marks inactive members

✅ Functions: calculate_bmi(), get_engagement_level(), get_member_status()

✅ Triggers: auto_calculate_bmi, validate_subscription

✅ Views: active_members_view, equipment_maintenance_view

=== WHAT I NEED (MINIMAL BUT COMPLETE) ===

🎯 EXACTLY 3 PAGES (Keep it simple):

1. DASHBOARD (/)

   - Cards showing: Total Active Members, Today's Attendance, Monthly Revenue

   - 2 charts: Attendance trend (last 30 days), Revenue by plan (pie chart)

   - Use Chart.js

2. MEMBERS (/members)

   - Table showing members from active_members_view

   - Columns: ID, Name, Email, Plan, Subscription Status, Days Remaining

   - "Add Member" button → simple form (first_name, last_name, email, phone, plan_id)

   - Search by name (simple filter)

3. ANALYTICS (/analytics)

   - Call update_all_engagement_scores() when page loads

   - Show "At-Risk Members" table (churn_risk_level = 'high' or 'critical')

   - Columns: Name, Engagement Score, Risk Level (color-coded badges)

   - 1 pie chart: Risk distribution (low/medium/high/critical)

=== TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS ===

Backend:

- Python Flask

- psycopg2-binary for PostgreSQL connection

- Connection pooling

- Simple error handling

Frontend:

- Bootstrap 5 (CDN)

- Chart.js (CDN)

- Minimal custom CSS

- No complex JavaScript (just basic AJAX for charts if needed)

Database Connection:

- Host: localhost

- Database: gym_management

- User: postgres

- Password: [I'll add in .env file]

- Port: 5432

=== PROJECT STRUCTURE NEEDED ===

fithub-gym/ ├── app.py # Main Flask app ├── database.py # DB connection utilities ├── .env # DB credentials ├── requirements.txt # Dependencies ├── templates/ │ ├── base.html # Base template with nav │ ├── dashboard.html # Dashboard page │ ├── members.html # Members list + add form │ └── analytics.html # Churn prediction └── static/ └── css/ └── custom.css # Minimal custom styles

=== CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS ===

✅ Must work with my EXISTING database (don't create new tables)

✅ Use my EXISTING views (active_members_view)

✅ Call my EXISTING procedures (update_all_engagement_scores)

✅ Simple, clean, Bootstrap-styled

✅ Copy-paste ready (I should just run and it works)

✅ Include complete database.py with connection pooling

✅ Include .env.example with all needed variables

=== PROVIDE ===

1. Complete app.py with all 3 routes

2. Complete database.py with execute_query() function

3. All 4 HTML templates (base + 3 pages)

4. requirements.txt

5. .env.example

6. Quick setup instructions (5 steps max)

=== STYLING ===

- Modern, professional look

- Use Bootstrap primary color for navbar

- Card-based layout

- Responsive design

- Simple, clean, no fancy animations

=== CHARTS (Chart.js) ===

Dashboard:

- Line chart: Daily attendance (last 30 days)

- Pie chart: Revenue by membership plan

Analytics:

- Pie chart: Churn risk distribution

Keep chart code simple and inline in templates.

=== EXAMPLE QUERIES I'LL USE ===

Members page: SELECT * FROM active_members_view ORDER BY member_id DESC LIMIT 50

Analytics page: 

- CALL update_all_engagement_scores()

- SELECT * FROM member_engagement_scores WHERE churn_risk_level IN ('high', 'critical')

Dashboard:

- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM members WHERE status='active'

- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM attendance WHERE date=CURRENT_DATE

=== CONSTRAINTS ===

❌ NO login/authentication (not needed for demo)

❌ NO complex features (keep it minimal)

❌ NO separate API layer (routes can return HTML directly)

❌ NO delete operations (just add/view)

❌ NO pagination (LIMIT 50 is fine)

✅ YES simple and working

✅ YES easy to understand

✅ YES ready to demo

=== GOAL ===

I want to copy-paste your code, run "pip install -r requirements.txt", edit .env with my password, run "python app.py", open browser to localhost:5000, and see it working with my existing database data.

This is for academic demo in 1 day. Prioritize: SIMPLE, WORKING, CLEAN.

Make it beginner-friendly and demo-ready!
